# RISC-V-Processor
A single-cycle RISC-V processor core in Verilog, implementing RV32I instructions: ADDI, ADD, SUB, LW, SW. Features a program counter, 256x32-bit instruction/data memory, 32x32-bit register file, and ALU. Simulated with Icarus Verilog on EDA Playground and synthesized with Yosys for iCE40 FPGA (~200-300 LUTs, Fmax ~100-120 MHz).
